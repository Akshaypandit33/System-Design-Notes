# Why Networking Matters in System Design?

- Every system relies on data exchange between components
- Networking enables scalability, reliability and performance
- Key areas where networking plays a crucial role:
	- Communication : Ensuring smooth data transfer between clients, servers and databases
	- Load Balancing:  Distributing traffic efficiently to prevent overload on a single server
	- Security: Protecting data from unauthorized access and cyber threats
	- Efficiency: Optimizing network performance to reduce latency and improve user experience

# How Networking Impacts Large-Scale Systems
- Helps handle millions of users concurrently
- Enables fast and efficient data exchange
- Reduces latency & improves system resilience
- Essentials for cloud computing & distributed system

# IP Addressing

- IP(Internet Protocol) address are unique numerical identifier assigned to every device that is connected  to internet
- They enable devices to exchange information seamlessly
- They enable communication between different machines, servers and services across internet.
- Two primary versions:
	- IPv4
	- IPv6

### IPv4

- It is most widely used addressing system.
- 32-bit address format(e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- Total addresses available: ~4.3 billion
- Uses: Traditional networking, web servers, and most current internet devices.
- Challenges: Limited IPs, fragmentation , and security concerns

### IPv6

- It is next-generation IP standard.
- 128-bit address format 
- It uses Hexadecimal notation separated by colons
- Total addresses available: 340 undecillion (virtual unlimited)
- Designed for: IoT, mobile networks and future scalability.
- Key benefits: Larger address space, better security and improved routing efficiency

### Private vs. Public IPs
- ### Public IPs:
	- Assigned by ISPs (Internet service providers ).
	- Used to communicate over the internet.
	- Unique worldwide.
	- Example : 192.203.23.45
- ### Private IPs:
	- Used within local networks(LANs, enterprises, homes).
	- Cannot be accessed directly from the internet.
	- examples:
		- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
		- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
		- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
## Why do we need private IPs?
- Conserves public IP addresses (IPv4 limitation)
- Enhances security (private IPs are not routable over the internet).
- Enables Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow multiple devices to share a single public IP.
- Common in corporate networks, data centers, and cloud environments.


## The Role of IPs in System Design

- **Scalability** : Helps in designing distributed, multi-region, and cloud-based architectures.
- **Security:** Enables firewall rules, VPNs, and private networking.
- **Load Balancing:** Uses IP-based traffic distribution(e.g., Round-robin DNS, Anycast IPs).
- **Cloud Networking:** Public, private, and hybrid cloud IP management (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Microservices & Containers:** Use internal private IPs for communication

## Common System Design Interview Question on IPs
- How do IPv4 and IPv6 address differ?
- Why do we need private IPs in system design?
- How does NAT help in addressing in IPv4 shortage?
- Explain how a load balancer distributes traffic using IPs.
- How does DNS resolve IP addresses in large-scale system?

# How DNS Works

- **What is DNS?**
	- The "Phonebook of the internet."
	- Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.

## Type of DNS Servers

- **Root Name Servers:** Top-level servers handling .com, .org, etc.
- **TLD Name Server:** Specific to domains like .com, .net
- **Authoritative Name Servers:** Store domain-specific records.
- **Recursive Resolvers:** Handle queries on behalf of users, contacting multiple DNS servers if necessary

    E[Authoritative Name Servers]
    F[Resolved IP Address]
    G[Website Loads]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G

```


## DNS Caching and Performance Optimization

- **Why Caching matters?**
	- Reduces latency
	- Reduces load on DNS servers
- **Where caching occurs?**
	- Browser cache(stores previous lookups)
	- OS Cache (/etc/hosts, Windows DNS cache)
	- Recursive Resolver cache (ISP level)
- Time-To-Live (TTL) : Determines how long a cached record is valid.

## The Domain Name Resolution Process

Step by step breakdown of how DNS resolves a domain name:

    A[User types a domain name in the browser]
    B[Browser cache check if the IP is already known]
    C[Operating system cache check]
    D[Query to the local DNS resolver ISP or configured DNS server]
    E[If not found query goes to root DNS servers]
    F[TLD top level domain servers provide authoritative DNS server details]
    G[Authoritative DNS server returns the IP address]
    H[Response is cached and returned to the user]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H

```


## Importance of DNS in Large-Scale Systems

- Ensuring High availability
	- Load balancing using DNS
	- Anycast DNS for faster global resolution
- DNS Failover Strategies
	- primary and secondary DNS servers
	- If primary fails, request are automatically routed to backup server
- CDNs & DNS
	- How DNS directs users to the nearest CDN node for fast loading
- DNS Security Risks
	- DNS poisoning, cache poisoning and DDoS attacks.

# Client-Server Model Explained

## what is the Client-Server Model?
- A computing model where clients request services and server provide them.
- Foundation of modern web, database, and application architectures.
- why it is important?
	- Enables efficient resource management.
	- Used in web browsing, email, APIs, databases, and cloud services.
- Real-world examples:
	- Browsing a website (Browser = Client, Web Server = server)
	- Sending an email (Email App = client, Mail Server = server).

## Key Components of the client-server model
- **Client:**
	- The user-facing application that sends request.
	- Examples: Web browser, mobile app, API consumer.
- **Server:**
	- A system that processes requests and returns responses.
	- Examples: web server, database server, mail server.
- **Network:**
	- The medium that facilitates communication between clients and servers.
	- Examples: Internet, LAN, Wi-Fi, 5G

## How clients and servers communicate

- **Basic Steps:**
	- client sends a request (HTTP, SQL, query, etc. )
	- Request is transmitted over the network
	- Server receives and processes the request.
	- Server sends a response.
	- Client receives and processes the response.
- Types of Communications:
	- Request/Response Model (e.g., HTTP, Rest APIs )
	- Persistent Connections (e.g., Web Sockets, FTP sessions) for Real time communication
